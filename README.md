## Alarmclock with Nextion Touch and ESP8266

### ESP8266, 4 Alarms, Nextion HMI, MP3 alarm sound, light sensor, weather forecast, RTC with time sync..

Another ESP8266 project that has to do with IoT.
This is an alarm clock with 4 independent alarm times.
-The internal Real Time Clock (RTC) is synchronized via the Internet.

-The alarm melody is played by a mini MP3 player with an SD card.

-Current and future weather information is obtained from the Internet and displayed as symbols and text.

-An ambient light sensor DIMMs the display in the dark.

-The moon phases are calculated and displayed as symbols

Some details have never been quite finished but the alarm clock wakes me up since December 2017 reliably every day.
